# university-michigan-data-science

This repository contains materials of my learning Pandas and Numpy modules
on the course of Michigan University 'Applied Data Science with Python'.

Directory 'assignments' contains my labs which I accomplished to pass
each module of the course.

The repository also contains datasets, lectures Jupiter notebooks
files and other learning materials.

!It is not for other learners, but instead it is to present my skills
I have obtained on this course
